# Windexer High-Level Design

## Overview

Windexer is a high-performance indexing solution for the Solana blockchain. It is designed to efficiently process and store blockchain data, making it quickly accessible for various applications and analytics.

## System Components

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - RPC Client: Connects to Solana nodes to fetch new blocks and transactions.
   - Block Processor: Parses raw block data into structured format.

2. **Storage**
   - ScyllaDB: NoSQL database for storing processed blockchain data.
   - ClickHouse: Column-oriented DBMS for analytical queries.

3. **Indexing Engine**
   - Account Indexer: Processes and indexes account updates.
   - Transaction Indexer: Indexes transactions and their related data.
   - Custom Indexers: WebAssembly modules for specialized indexing logic.

4. **Query Layer**
   - GraphQL API: Provides a flexible interface for querying indexed data.
   - REST API: Offers a traditional REST interface for simpler queries.

5. **Monitoring & Metrics**
   - Prometheus: Collects and stores metrics.
   - Grafana: Visualizes metrics and provides alerting.

## Data Flow

1. The RPC Client continuously fetches new blocks from Solana nodes.
2. The Block Processor parses these blocks and extracts relevant data.
3. The Indexing Engine processes this data, updating account states and transaction records.
4. Processed data is stored in ScyllaDB for quick access and ClickHouse for analytics.
5. The Query Layer provides APIs for applications to access this indexed data.
6. The Monitoring system tracks the health and performance of all components.

## Scalability and Performance

- Horizontal scaling: Add more nodes to handle increased load.
- Sharding: Distribute data across multiple database instances.
- Caching: Implement multi-level caching to reduce database load.
- Parallel processing: Utilize multi-threading for concurrent data processing.

## Security Considerations

- Encryption: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Access Control: Implement role-based access control for API endpoints.
- Rate Limiting: Protect against DoS attacks with rate limiting.
- Regular Audits: Conduct security audits and penetration testing.

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time data streaming
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Cross-chain indexing capabilities
